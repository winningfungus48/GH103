# Game Hub – GH1.1_v1 Plan
**Release Type:** Post-1.0.0 Stability & Expansion  
**Primary Goal:** Improve and expand Game Hub 1.0.0 with a focus on stability, scalable modular systems, and rapid game library growth. **No monetization or analytics in this release.**  

---

## ✅ 1. Core Objectives
1. **Finalize Modular Systems**  
   - Ensure universal UI components, templated logic, and modular hooks are complete so **no future UI or logic rewrites** are required for new games.  

2. **Bug Fixes & Stability**  
   - Full regression testing & technical debt cleanup.  
   - Fix any outstanding issues (e.g., category filtering, Back to Top button visibility, edge-case localStorage errors).  

3. **Game Expansion**  
   - Migrate & develop **10 total games** (mix of -le style, casual puzzles, and possibly partner-prep games).  
   - Ensure all new games meet **consistent UI/UX** standards from Day 1.  

4. **Scalability & Consistency**  
   - Confirm all logic (localStorage, hooks, templates) is **modular and scalable** for future rapid development.  

5. **Partner Game Integration Prep**  
   - Establish shared coding standards, migration checklist, and testable infrastructure before actual partner game migration.

## ✅ 2. Phase Breakdown (GH1.1 Series)

### **1.1.1 – Post-Release Stability & Technical Debt Cleanup**  
**Goal:** Stabilize 1.0.0 before adding new content.  

**Key Tasks:**  
- Full **regression testing** (favorites, filtering, recently played, scroll logic).  
- Fix edge-case bugs and ensure incognito/offline fallbacks work.  
- **ESLint + Prettier enforcement** pass.  
- Remove unused/legacy files & redundant CSS.  
- Mobile UI/UX refinements and adjustments.

**Definition of Done:**
- Zero critical bugs, all regression tests passing
- ESLint/Prettier compliance = 100%
- Mobile responsiveness verified across all components

**Risks & Rollback:**
- Risk: ESLint changes may introduce new issues
- Rollback: Revert to last stable commit if regression testing fails

---

### **1.1.2 – Modular Systems & Universal UI Finalization**  
**Goal:** Ensure future games use fully standardized, reusable systems.  

**Key Tasks:**  
- Complete **useGameState** & **useGameCompletion** hooks.  
- Finalize **Universal Modal**, toast system, and ARIA refinements.  
- Confirm scalable **localStorage.js** namespace with version key.  
- Performance utilities: `useDebounce`, `useThrottle`, `useInterval`.  

**Definition of Done:**
- Template system documented & tested with at least one demo game
- All hooks implemented and tested
- Universal UI components finalized

**Dependencies:** Requires 1.1.1 completion

---

### **1.1.3 – New Games Batch 1 (3–5 Games)**  
**Goal:** Rapidly expand library while stress-testing templates.  

**Key Tasks:**  
- Build 3–5 new **-le and casual puzzle games** using finalized templates.  
- Ensure games follow **responsive & accessibility standards**.  
- Metadata baseline: `metaDescription`, `keywords`, `previewImage`.  

**Definition of Done:**
- 3–5 new games with consistent UI/UX and responsive verification
- All games pass accessibility standards
- Template system stress-tested and validated

**Risks & Rollback:**
- Risk: Templates may not be fully ready
- Mitigation: Fallback to building 1–2 games manually while completing the system
- Rollback: Revert to last stable commit if template issues arise

**Dependencies:** Requires 1.1.2 completion

---

### **1.1.4 – Partner Game Migration Infrastructure Prep**  
**Goal:** Prepare for smooth partner integration later.  

**Key Tasks:**  
- Create **Partner Game Migration Checklist** (naming, testing, metadata, responsive rules).  
- Document shared coding standards & commit workflow for contributions.  
- Test migration pipeline with 1–2 placeholder partner-like games.  
- Include React 18 + Vite compatibility and build size guidelines.

**Definition of Done:**
- Migration checklist validated with 1–2 sample games
- Documentation complete for simple React game integration
- Migration issues documented during placeholder tests

**Risks & Rollback:**
- Risk: Partner game complexity may be higher than expected
- Mitigation: Scope to simple React games only in GH1.1
- Rollback: Revert to last stable commit if integration issues arise

**Dependencies:** Requires 1.1.3 completion

---

### **1.1.5 – New Games Batch 2 + Consistency Pass**  
**Goal:** Finish the target of 10 games & final polish.  

**Key Tasks:**  
- Add 5 more games (mix of templates & partner-prepped).  
- Perform **UI/UX consistency audit** across all games.  
- Finalize **universal polish pass** (hover states, responsive tweaks).  

**Definition of Done:**
- Total 10 games completed
- Full UI consistency audit passes
- All games meet responsive and accessibility standards

**Dependencies:** Requires 1.1.4 completion

---

### **1.1.6 – Final Stability & Public Launch Prep**  
**Goal:** Lock GH1.1 as a polished, stable release.  

**Key Tasks:**  
- Full **regression testing** of all games & systems.  
- **Final performance pass** (lazy loading, React.memo optimizations).  
- Document all completed work in `/docs/phases/` + Roadmap update.

**Definition of Done:**
- Performance benchmarks met (lazy loading under 200ms impact, stable mobile FPS)
- Full regression testing passed
- All documentation updated

**Dependencies:** Requires 1.1.5 completion

---

### **1.1.7 – Spillover & Final Polish**  
**Goal:** Dedicated phase for any delayed partner migration or general refinements before public launch.

**Key Tasks:**
- Address any remaining polish items from previous phases
- Final partner game integration refinements if needed
- Last-minute UI/UX improvements
- Final validation and testing

**Definition of Done:**
- All phase objectives completed
- Release ready for public launch
- Zero critical issues remaining

**Dependencies:** Requires 1.1.6 completion

---

## ✅ 3. Game Selection Strategy
- **Target Games:** Focus on **templated-friendly games (-le style, word/logic puzzles, and casual skill games)** for the first batches
- **Priority:** Approximately **70–80% of the 10-game target will be template-friendly**, ensuring the new systems are stress-tested
- **Partner Games:** Simple React games, aligned with existing tech stack (React 18 + Vite)
- **Complexity:** Partner games should be similar to our own (-le-like, React-based casual puzzles)

---

## ✅ 4. GH1.1 Deliverables
- **10 fully integrated games** (templated & consistent).  
- **No UI/UX rewrites needed for future games** after this release.  
- **Documented partner migration process** (ready for GH1.2 or later).  
- **Stable, public-ready build** with zero critical bugs.  

---

## ✅ 5. Next Steps (GH1.2 Preview)
- Privacy Policy finalization.  
- Lightweight GA4 testing & privacy compliance updates.  
- Ads & monetization prep (banner zones + customization).  

---

## ✅ 6. Development Guidelines for Cursor
1. **Strictly follow the new DoD, risk, and rollback structure phase by phase**
2. **Partner game prep work (1.1.4) should focus on documenting migration issues during the placeholder tests**
3. **Mobile UI/UX refinements are priority in 1.1.1**
4. **Template system stress-testing is critical in 1.1.3**
5. **Performance benchmarks must be met in 1.1.6**
