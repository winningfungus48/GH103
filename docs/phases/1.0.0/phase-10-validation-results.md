# Phase 10 Final Report: Core Refactors & Best Practices

## Summary of Actions

### 1. Linting & Formatting
- Confirmed only standard ESLint/Prettier configs are present (`.eslintrc.json`, `.prettierrc`).
- No `.editorconfig` or conflicting formatting files found.
- All code formatted and linted according to recommended settings.

### 2. LocalStorage Centralization
- All direct localStorage usages for Numberle stats and theme mode are now routed through utility functions in `src/utils/localStorage.js`:
  - `getNumberleStats` / `setNumberleStats`
  - `getThemeMode` / `setThemeMode`
- Robust error handling and silent failover implemented.

### 3. Atomic Design & Folder Structure
- Moved `Toast` and `BackToTop` components (and their CSS) to `atoms/` for atomic design consistency.
- Updated all imports accordingly.
- All other components confirmed to be in appropriate atomic folders.

### 4. CSS Modules & Naming
- Audited all CSS modules for naming consistency (`ComponentName.module.css`).
- Checked all className usages; no unused or inconsistently named classes found.
- All classes are camelCase or PascalCase for root containers.

### 5. Unused/Legacy Files
- No files were deleted.
- Any files identified as unused or legacy during the audit have been logged in `docs/phases/1.0.0/phase-10-audit-log.md` for future review.

### 6. Manual Validation & QA
- Manual validation performed on:
  - Latest Chrome desktop
  - Mobile browser (Chrome on Android)
- All core flows (favorites, recently played, navigation, game play) tested and functional.
- No visual regressions or console errors found.
- Validation results documented in this file and in the audit log.

### 7. Documentation
- All changes, audit findings, and validation results are documented in:
  - `docs/phases/1.0.0/phase-10-audit-log.md`
  - `docs/phases/1.0.0/phase-10-validation-results.md`
  - Migration and refactor approach in `docs/migration-guide.md`

### 8. Code Quality
- All code changes made in atomic, well-described commits.
- Codebase is clean, consistent, and ready for Phase 11.
