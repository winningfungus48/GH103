## üö® Risks & Mitigation

### Risk: Games may not meet consistency standards
**Mitigation:**
- Implement strict consistency checks
- Create consistency checklist
- Review games incrementally

### Risk: Performance may degrade with 10 games
**Mitigation:**
- Monitor performance metrics closely
- Implement optimization strategies
- Test performance regularly

### Risk: Integration issues may arise
**Mitigation:**
- Test integration incrementally
- Have rollback plan for problematic games
- Document integration requirements clearly

---

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If consistency issues arise:
1. Identify inconsistent games
2. Revert problematic games to previous state
3. Fix consistency issues in isolation
4. Re-integrate after fixes

If performance issues arise:
1. Identify performance bottlenecks
2. Implement optimization strategies
3. Test performance improvements
4. Monitor performance metrics
