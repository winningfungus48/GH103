# Phase 1 â€“ Scaffold Project  
**Game Hub Development Documentation**  

## âœ… Summary  
Phase 1 established the foundational React + Vite scaffold for the Game Hub project. This phase focused on creating a clean, modern development environment, initializing version control, and pushing the first working commit to GitHub. It served as the baseline for all subsequent phases by ensuring a reproducible, organized, and properly versioned project structure.

---

## ðŸ›  Goals  
- Generate a new React 18 + Vite application scaffold.  
- Remove any default Vite demo files to keep the project clean.  
- Initialize Git version control and connect the project to the dedicated GitHub repository (`GH103`).  
- Perform the initial commit and push to GitHub as the baseline for all future development.  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Tasks Completed  

### 1. Project Generation  
- Used **Vite CLI** to scaffold a React 18 project with the following command:  
  ```bash
  npm create vite@latest game-hub
  ```
- Selected the React + JavaScript template for lightweight, modern setup.  

### 2. Dependency Installation  
- Installed all core dependencies:  
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```  

### 3. Default File Cleanup  
- Removed all unnecessary Vite demo files, including:  
  - `/src/assets/react.svg`  
  - `/src/App.css`, `/src/index.css` (default styles)  
  - Placeholder React components (`App.jsx`, `main.jsx` were cleaned but preserved).  

### 4. Version Control Setup  
- Initialized Git within the local project directory (`C:/Dev/GH103`).  
- Connected to the GitHub repository named **GH103**.  
- Configured `.gitignore` to exclude `node_modules` and build files.

### 5. Initial Commit & Push  
- Created the first commit with the following structured message:  

  ```
  [feat] Phase 1 â€“ Scaffold Project  
  - Generated React + Vite scaffold  
  - Removed default Vite demo files for a clean baseline  
  - Initialized Git and connected to GH103 repository  
  ```  

- Pushed the commit to the main branch on GitHub, successfully confirming the repository connection.  

---

## ðŸ“¦ Deliverables  

- **Clean React + Vite Scaffold** â€“ A fresh, empty app structure, free from unnecessary Vite placeholders.  
- **Version Control Integration** â€“ Fully operational Git + GitHub setup.  
- **Baseline Commit** â€“ Establishes a reliable restore point for future phases.

---

## ðŸ”— Relevant Files at the End of Phase 1  
- `/src/App.jsx` (empty app shell, to be built in Phase 2)  
- `/src/main.jsx` (default Vite entry, cleaned for project use)  
- `package.json` (Vite + React configuration)  
- `.gitignore` (standard Node + Vite rules)

---

## ðŸ§­ Next Steps (Phase 2 Preview)  
- **Clean Starter Template:** Remove any remaining placeholders, establish the modular folder structure (`/components`, `/pages`, `/games`, `/data`), and prepare the App shell for layout development.
