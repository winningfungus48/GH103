# Phase 12 Validation â€“ Modular Game System & Templates

**Goal:** Confirm that reusable systems are implemented correctly and refactors do not break existing games.

---

## âœ… Validation Checklist

### **Game Lifecycle Hooks**
- [ ] `useGameState` properly handles initialization, updates, and resets
- [ ] `useGameCompletion` correctly identifies completed games and triggers appropriate callbacks

### **Templating Structure**
- [ ] Templates are easy to apply to a new game with minimal boilerplate
- [ ] Props and lifecycle methods (`initialState`, `isComplete`, `getFeedback`) work as expected

### **Game Refactors**
- [ ] Refactored games (e.g., Numberle) behave exactly as before (no gameplay changes)
- [ ] No new console warnings or errors introduced by refactor

---

## ðŸ§ª Edge Cases & Testing
- [ ] Templates handle invalid or missing state gracefully
- [ ] Multiple games can run simultaneously without state conflicts
- [ ] Resetting a game fully clears state and restarts correctly

## âœ… Sign-Off
- [ ] All checklist items verified and approved before moving to Phase 13
