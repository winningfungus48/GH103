# Phase 12 Audit Log – Modular Game System & Templates

**Goal:** Establish reusable systems for future games, reducing duplicate logic and improving maintainability.

---

## 📋 Summary of Affected Areas
- Game state, completion, and reset logic previously duplicated in each game (e.g., Numberle)
- UI and lifecycle logic now modularized via hooks and a flexible template
- Numberle refactored to use the new system, with all UI/UX preserved

---

## ✅ Audit Checklist
- [x] Identified duplicated lifecycle logic in games
- [x] Created generic `useGameState` and `useGameCompletion` hooks
- [x] Implemented flexible `GameTemplate` component
- [x] Refactored Numberle to use new modular system
- [x] Preserved all gameplay and UI/UX
- [x] Added usage documentation for future games

---

## 📝 Recommendations
- Use the new template and hooks for all future puzzle/logic games
- Extend with additional config or render props as new game types are added
- See `docs/usage/game-template.md` for usage examples
