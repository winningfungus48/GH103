## âœ… Validation Checklist

### Universal Modal System
- [ ] Modal opens and closes smoothly across all screen sizes (controlled via `open`/`onClose` props)
- [ ] Modal supports keyboard navigation and focus trapping

- [ ] Only a single modal instance is present at a time

### Toast & Notifications Refinement

- [ ] Supports basic types (`success`, `error`, `info`) with correct color/icon
- [ ] ARIA attributes are applied for screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Animations are smooth and non-intrusive
- [ ] Toast system uses provider pattern and queue-based stacking

### Performance & Lazy Loading Review
- [ ] Lazy loading reduces initial bundle size (verified via build output)
- [ ] Dynamic imports in `gamesData.js` only load games when opened
- [ ] No duplicate game imports or unused chunks remain after review

### Documentation & Guidelines
- [ ] Inline usage examples for modal and toast are present in code
- [ ] `ui-guidelines.md` includes best practices, code snippets, and contributor checklist
