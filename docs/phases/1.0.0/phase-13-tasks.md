# Phase 13 Tasks – UI & UX Consistency Foundation

**Goal:** Create shared, reusable UI patterns to ensure visual consistency and reduce duplicate UI code.

---

## ✅ Task Checklist

### **13.1 – Universal Modal System**
- [ ] Build a generic `<Modal />` component to handle win/lose dialogs, info popups, and future daily/leaderboard modals

### **13.2 – Toast & Notifications Refinement**
- [ ] Ensure consistent placement, animation, and ARIA support for accessibility
- [ ] Standardize toast component usage across all interactive elements

### **13.3 – Performance & Lazy Loading Review**
- [ ] Optimize route-based lazy loading to reduce initial bundle size
- [ ] Confirm no duplicate game imports or unused chunks

---

## 📝 Notes
- Modal system should be easily extensible for future phases (daily games, leaderboards)
- Toast animations and ARIA updates should improve both UX and accessibility
