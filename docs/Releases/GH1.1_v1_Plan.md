# Game Hub – GH1.1_v1 Plan
**Release Type:** Post-1.0.0 Stability & Expansion  
**Primary Goal:** Improve and expand Game Hub 1.0.0 with a focus on stability, scalable modular systems, and rapid game library growth. **No monetization or analytics in this release.**  

---

## ✅ 1. Core Objectives
1. **Finalize Modular Systems**  
   - Ensure universal UI components, templated logic, and modular hooks are complete so **no future UI or logic rewrites** are required for new games.  

2. **Bug Fixes & Stability**  
   - Full regression testing & technical debt cleanup.  
   - Fix any outstanding issues (e.g., category filtering, Back to Top button visibility, edge-case localStorage errors).  

3. **Game Expansion**  
   - Migrate & develop **10 total games** (mix of -le style, casual puzzles, and possibly partner-prep games).  
   - Ensure all new games meet **consistent UI/UX** standards from Day 1.  

4. **Scalability & Consistency**  
   - Confirm all logic (localStorage, hooks, templates) is **modular and scalable** for future rapid development.  

5. **Partner Game Integration Prep**  
   - Establish shared coding standards, migration checklist, and testable infrastructure before actual partner game migration.

---

### **1.1.4 – Partner Game Migration Infrastructure Prep**  
**Goal:** Prepare for smooth partner integration later.  

**Key Tasks:**  
- Create **Partner Game Migration Checklist** (naming, testing, metadata, responsive rules).  
- Document shared coding standards & commit workflow for contributions.  
- Test migration pipeline with 1–2 placeholder partner-like games.  

---

### **1.1.5 – New Games Batch 2 + Consistency Pass**  
**Goal:** Finish the target of 10 games & final polish.  

**Key Tasks:**

- Finalize **universal polish pass** (hover states, responsive tweaks).  

---

### **1.1.6 – Final Stability & Public Launch Prep**  
**Goal:** Lock GH1.1 as a polished, stable release.  

**Key Tasks:**  
- Full **regression testing** of all games & systems.  
- **Final performance pass** (lazy loading, React.memo optimizations).  
- Document all completed work in `/docs/phases/` + Roadmap update.

---

## ✅ 3. GH1.1 Deliverables
- **10 fully integrated games** (templated & consistent).  
- **No UI/UX rewrites needed for future games** after this release.
