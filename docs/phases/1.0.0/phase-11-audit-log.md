# Phase 11 Audit Log ‚Äì State Management & Persistence Foundation

**Goal:** Identify all areas impacted by the refactor of global state and persistence (favorites, recently played), and document current implementation, gaps, and recommendations for Phase 11.

---

## üìã Summary of Affected Areas

- **Favorites State:**
  - Managed via `FavoritesProvider` (`src/context/FavoritesProvider.jsx`)
  - Uses `getFavorites` and `toggleFavorite` from `src/utils/localStorage.js`
  - Consumed in components like `Home.jsx` for filtering
- **Recently Played State:**
  - Managed via `addToRecentlyPlayed` in `src/utils/localStorage.js`
  - Used in `GameWrapper.jsx` to track recently played games
- **localStorage Schema:**
  - Keys: `favorites`, `recentlyPlayed` (no namespacing or versioning)
  - No schema versioning or migration logic present
- **Context Providers:**
  - `FavoritesProvider` (global state for favorites)
  - No scaffolds for `PlayerContext`, `DailyContext` (to be added)
- **Edge Case Handling:**
  - No migration logic for old keys or corrupted data
  - No versioning (`gh_schemaVersion`) or namespacing (`gh_` prefix)
  - No explicit handling for multiple tabs, rapid toggling, or localStorage clearing

## ‚úÖ Audit Checklist

- [x] Located all favorites and recently played state management logic
- [x] Identified all localStorage keys and usage patterns
- [x] Reviewed all context providers and their consumers
- [x] Checked for existing migration/versioning logic (none found)
- [x] Noted missing scaffolds for future providers
- [x] Assessed edge case handling (gaps found)

---

## üìù Recommendations

- Migrate localStorage keys to `gh_favorites`, `gh_recentlyPlayed`, and add `gh_schemaVersion`
- Implement migration logic (with fallback/cleanup for old/corrupt data)
- Refactor `FavoritesProvider` and related logic for scalability
- Add empty scaffolds for `PlayerContext` and `DailyContext` in `src/context/`
- Ensure all changes are atomic and well-documented
- Test edge cases: rapid toggling, multiple tabs, clearing localStorage

*See this log for reference during implementation and validation. All changes and findings will be documented here as Phase 11 progresses.* 

---

## üîÑ Implementation Updates (Mid-Phase)

- All favorites and recently played logic is now accessed exclusively through utility helpers (`getFavorites`, `toggleFavorite`, `isFavorite`, `addRecentlyPlayed`, `isRecentlyPlayed`).
- No direct array manipulation or legacy helper usage remains in any component.
- `Home.jsx` updated to use `isFavorite` for all favorite checks.
- `GameWrapper.jsx` updated to use `addRecentlyPlayed` for tracking recently played games.
- Timestamp-based concurrency guards implemented for both favorites and recently played writes.
- Helpers encapsulate fallback logic for old keys, ensuring backward compatibility until 2.0.0.
