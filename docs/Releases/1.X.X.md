# Game Hub Roadmap v7  
### Release 1.0.0 – Core Foundations

This release focuses exclusively on **core functionality, code health, and best practices** to ensure long-term maintainability and scalability. All expansion-oriented features (daily games, leaderboards, multiplayer, analytics, ads) are deferred to the next release.

---

## Phase 10 – Core Refactors & Best Practices

**Goal:** Standardize and clean the existing codebase to align with best practices and ensure maintainability.  

**Key Tasks:**  
1. **Code Health & Linting**  
   - Finalize Prettier + ESLint rules for consistency.  
   - Remove unused or legacy files.  
   - Enforce atomic design principles across components.

2. **LocalStorage & Utilities Audit**  
   - Consolidate all localStorage logic into a single `localStorage.js` namespace.  
   - Add robust error handling and safe fallbacks for incognito/offline modes.  

3. **Folder & Component Audit**  
   - Ensure all components follow consistent folder naming (`atoms/`, `molecules/`, `organisms/`).  
   - Standardize CSS Modules (naming conventions, remove unused classes).

## Phase 11 – State Management & Persistence Foundation

**Goal:** Strengthen global state and persistence to make adding future systems easier.  

**Key Tasks:**  
1. **Favorites & Recently Played Refactor**  
   - Rewrite with scalable structure (future support for multiplayer and daily stats).  
   - Deduplicate logic and ensure clear data shape in localStorage.  

2. **Context Provider Updates**  
   - Review and refactor `FavoritesProvider` and related contexts for long-term scalability.  
   - Add placeholders for future providers (e.g., `PlayerContext`, `DailyContext`).  

3. **Structured LocalStorage Schema**  
   - Introduce namespacing convention (`gh_favorites`, `gh_recentlyPlayed`).  
   - Add versioning key to prepare for schema migration in future releases.

---

## Phase 12 – Modular Game System & Templates

**Goal:** Establish reusable systems for future games, reducing duplicate logic.  

**Key Tasks:**  
1. **Game Lifecycle Hooks**  
   - Create shared hooks (`useGameState`, `useGameCompletion`) for managing in-progress state, completion checks, and reset logic.  

2. **Templating Structure**  
   - Introduce a basic template format for puzzle/logic games (Wordle-like).  
   - Provide clear props and lifecycle (`initialState`, `isComplete`, `getFeedback`).  

3. **Game Refactors**  
   - Refactor existing games (e.g., Numberle) to use the new templating system.

---

## Phase 13 – UI & UX Consistency Foundation

**Goal:** Create shared, reusable UI patterns to ensure visual consistency and reduce duplicate UI code.  

**Key Tasks:**  
1. **Universal Modal System**  
   - Build a generic `<Modal />` component to handle win/lose dialogs, info popups, and future daily/leaderboard modals.  

2. **Toast & Notifications Refinement**  
   - Ensure consistent placement, animation, and ARIA support for accessibility.  

3. **Performance & Lazy Loading Review**  
   - Optimize route-based lazy loading and confirm no duplicate game imports.

---

## Phase 14 – Performance & Scalability Prep

**Goal:** Prepare the codebase for future heavier features (multiplayer, daily, analytics).  

**Key Tasks:**  
1. **Utility Hooks for Performance**  
   - Add shared hooks (`useDebounce`, `useThrottle`, `useInterval`) for future game and UI performance needs.  

2. **Memoization & Rendering Optimization**  
   - Audit and apply `React.memo` and `useCallback` where beneficial.  

3. **Expansion Prep**  
   - Add lightweight stubs/placeholders for future analytics or backend sync (`trackEvent` refactor, version key in localStorage).
