# Phase 1.1.3 ‚Äì New Games Batch 1 (3‚Äì5 Games)

**Phase Goal:** Rapidly expand library while stress-testing templates.

**Dependencies:** Phase 1.1.2 completion

**Estimated Duration:** 4-5 days

---

## üìã Key Tasks

### 1. Game Selection & Planning
- [ ] Select 3-5 template-friendly games (-le style, word/logic puzzles, casual skill games)
- [ ] Prioritize games that can reuse existing templates (70-80% of batch)
- [ ] Document game requirements and mechanics
- [ ] Create implementation timeline for each game
- [ ] Identify any unique requirements that may need template extensions

### 2. Template Stress Testing
- [ ] Use finalized template system for all games
- [ ] Document any template limitations or issues encountered
- [ ] Extend templates if necessary for specific game requirements
- [ ] Validate template scalability with multiple games
- [ ] Update template documentation based on real-world usage

### 3. Game Implementation
- [ ] Implement each game using the template system
- [ ] Ensure consistent UI/UX across all games
- [ ] Implement responsive design for all games
- [ ] Add accessibility features (ARIA, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Integrate with existing systems (favorites, recently played, categories)

### 4. Metadata & SEO
- [ ] Add metaDescription for each game
- [ ] Add keywords for each game
- [ ] Create previewImage for each game
- [ ] Ensure proper title tags
- [ ] Add structured data where applicable

### 5. Quality Assurance
- [ ] Test each game thoroughly
- [ ] Verify responsive design on multiple devices
- [ ] Test accessibility features
- [ ] Validate integration with existing systems
- [ ] Performance testing for each game

### 6. Documentation
- [ ] Document each game's implementation
- [ ] Note any template extensions or customizations
- [ ] Create game-specific documentation
- [ ] Update game catalog
- [ ] Document lessons learned for future batches

## üö® Risks & Mitigation

### Risk: Templates may not be fully ready
**Mitigation:** 
- Fallback to building 1‚Äì2 games manually while completing the system
- Document template gaps for future improvement
- Prioritize simpler games first

### Risk: Games may not meet quality standards
**Mitigation:**
- Implement strict quality gates
- Test each game thoroughly before moving to next
- Have rollback plan for problematic games

### Risk: Performance may degrade with multiple games
**Mitigation:**
- Monitor performance metrics
- Implement lazy loading where appropriate
- Optimize game assets

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If template issues arise:
1. Revert to last stable commit
2. Document specific template problems
3. Create simplified template version
4. Re-implement incrementally with testing

If game quality issues arise:
1. Identify problematic games
2. Revert specific games to previous state
3. Fix issues in isolation
4. Re-integrate after fixes

## üéÆ Game Selection Guidelines

### Preferred Game Types
- Word puzzles (-le style games)
- Logic puzzles
- Casual skill games
- Number-based puzzles
- Pattern recognition games

### Template Compatibility
