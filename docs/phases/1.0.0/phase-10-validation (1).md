# Phase 10 Validation â€“ Core Refactors & Best Practices

**Goal:** Confirm that the codebase is consistent, clean, and follows established best practices.

---

## âœ… Validation Checklist

### Code Health & Linting
- [x] ESLint reports no errors or warnings in dev mode
- [x] Prettier formatting is applied consistently across all files
- [x] Legacy or unused files have been logged for future review (not deleted)

### LocalStorage & Utilities
- [x] All localStorage logic is centralized in `localStorage.js`
- [x] Keys follow a clear naming convention (e.g., `gh_favorites`)
- [x] Safe fallbacks exist for incognito/offline scenarios (no crashes or console errors)

### Folder & Component Structure
- [x] Components are properly organized under `atoms/`, `molecules/`, and `organisms/`
- [x] CSS Modules follow consistent naming conventions (no unused or duplicate class names)
- [x] Atomic design principles are applied consistently (no misplaced logic in atoms)

---

## ðŸ§ª Edge Cases & Testing
- [x] App compiles and runs successfully after refactor
- [x] Favorites and Recently Played remain functional post-refactor
- [x] No visual regressions in the homepage, game pages, or navigation

---

## âœ… Summary of Actions
- All direct localStorage usages for Numberle stats and theme mode are now routed through utility functions in `src/utils/localStorage.js` with robust error handling and silent failover.
- `Toast` and `BackToTop` components (and their CSS) have been moved to `atoms/` for atomic design consistency. All imports updated.
- All other components confirmed to be in appropriate atomic folders.
- All CSS modules audited for naming consistency and unused classes; no issues found.
- No files were deleted; unused/legacy files logged for future review in the audit log.
- Manual validation performed on latest Chrome desktop and mobile browser; all core flows tested and functional.
- All changes, audit findings, and validation results are documented in the audit log and migration guide.
- Codebase is clean, consistent, and ready for Phase 11.

## âœ… Sign-Off
- [x] All checklist items verified and approved; Phase 10 is complete and ready for the next phase.
