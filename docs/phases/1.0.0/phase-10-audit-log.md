# Phase 10 Audit Log â€“ Core Refactors & Best Practices

This document logs all findings from the Phase 10 audit, including direct localStorage usage, atomic design compliance, CSS module issues, and unused/legacy files. No files are deleted in this phase; this log is for future review and tracking.

---

## 1. Direct localStorage Usage (Outside Utility)
- [x] `src/games/numberle/Numberle.jsx`: Refactored to use `getNumberleStats` and `setNumberleStats` utility functions.
- [x] `src/games/numberle/numberle-script.js`: Refactored to use `getNumberleStats` and `setNumberleStats` utility functions.
- [x] `src/context/ThemeProvider.jsx`: Refactored to use `getThemeMode` and `setThemeMode` utility functions.
- All direct localStorage usages for Numberle stats and theme mode are now centralized through the utility module, with robust error handling and silent failover.

## 2. Atomic Design & Folder Structure
- [x] `Toast` and `BackToTop` have been moved to the `atoms/` directory. All imports have been updated accordingly.
- The atomic folder structure is now consistent for these shared UI elements.
- Most other components are organized under `atoms/`, `molecules/`, and other folders.
- All exported components will be cross-checked for correct folder placement during refactor.

## 3. CSS Modules & Naming
- CSS modules are used throughout, with files named `ComponentName.module.css`.
- Class names are mostly camelCase, but some game-specific styles may need review.
- Will cross-reference className usage in JS/JSX with CSS files to identify unused classes during refactor.

## 4. Unused/Legacy Files (Log Only)
- No files are deleted in this phase. Any files identified as unused or legacy will be listed here for future review after a full code scan and refactor.

## 5. Other Findings
- ESLint and Prettier are present and configured in `package.json`.
- `.editorconfig` or references to it may exist and need review/removal if present.
- Validation results will be documented in `phase-10-validation-results.md` after changes.

This log will be updated as the refactor progresses and will serve as a reference for future cleanup and review.
