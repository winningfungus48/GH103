# Phase 14 Tasks – Performance & Scalability Prep

**Goal:** Prepare the codebase for future heavier features (multiplayer, daily, analytics).

---

## ✅ Task Checklist

### **14.1 – Utility Hooks for Performance**
- [ ] Add shared hooks (`useDebounce`, `useThrottle`, `useInterval`) for future game and UI performance needs

### **14.2 – Memoization & Rendering Optimization**
- [ ] Audit components for unnecessary re-renders and apply `React.memo` where beneficial
- [ ] Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` for expensive operations or frequently passed props

### **14.3 – Expansion Prep**
- [ ] Add lightweight stubs/placeholders for future analytics or backend sync (`trackEvent` refactor, version key in localStorage)
- [ ] Confirm that all new utilities and placeholders do not affect current functionality

## 📝 Notes
- Focus on preparation and optimizations only; no analytics or backend logic should be fully implemented yet
- All optimizations should maintain readability and not overcomplicate component logic
