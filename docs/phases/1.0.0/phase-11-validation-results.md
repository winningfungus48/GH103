# Phase 11 Validation Results ‚Äì State Management & Persistence Foundation

**Goal:** Validate that global state and persistence are robust, scalable, and future-proof as per Phase 11 requirements.

---

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist
- [x] Favorites toggle correctly after refactor
- [x] Recently Played tracking works and preserves existing history
- [x] No duplicate entries or unexpected overwrites in localStorage
- [x] All component access is via helpers only (no direct array manipulation)
- [x] isFavorite, addRecentlyPlayed, isRecentlyPlayed helpers work as expected
- [x] FavoritesProvider remains functional after refactor
- [x] Context scaffolding for future providers (files only) does not break current functionality
- [x] Keys follow the new naming convention (`gh_` prefix)
- [x] Versioning key (`gh_schemaVersion`) is stored as a simple string and retrievable without breaking older data
- [x] Centralized migration logic is present and runs only on app load
- [x] Helpers encapsulate fallback for old keys until 2.0.0
- [x] Safe migration logic for pre-existing keys is confirmed (only runs if new keys are missing; clears old keys on failure)
- [x] Timestamp-based concurrency guard is present for favorites and recently played
- [x] No data loss or crashes in multi-tab scenarios (last write wins)

**Notes:**
- All validation steps were performed on latest Chrome desktop and mobile (Chrome for Android). No issues found.

## üß™ Edge Cases & Testing
- [x] App compiles and runs successfully after refactor
- [x] No console warnings or errors related to localStorage or context
- [x] Clearing localStorage does not crash the app
- [x] Rapid toggling of favorites does not create duplicates or errors
- [x] Multiple tabs open: no duplicate migration or crashes
- [x] Manual validation performed on latest Chrome desktop + one mobile browser

**Notes:**
- Edge cases tested as described. All behaviors matched expectations. App is stable and robust.

## üïí Concurrency Tests
- [x] Multi-tab: Rapidly toggle favorites in two tabs ‚Äì last write wins, no data loss
- [x] Multi-tab: Add/remove recently played in two tabs ‚Äì last write wins, no data loss
- [x] Simulate localStorage clearing mid-session ‚Äì app recovers gracefully, no crashes

**Notes:**
- Concurrency guard works as intended. No data loss or race conditions observed. App recovers cleanly from localStorage clearing.
