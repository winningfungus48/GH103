## üö® Risks & Mitigation

### Risk: ESLint changes may introduce new issues
**Mitigation:** 
- Test thoroughly after ESLint configuration changes
- Run full regression suite after each major change
- Have rollback plan ready

### Risk: Mobile fixes may break desktop functionality
**Mitigation:**
- Test both desktop and mobile after each change
- Use responsive design principles
- Maintain cross-browser compatibility

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If regression testing fails:
1. Revert to last stable commit
2. Document the specific issue that caused the failure
3. Create a new branch for the problematic changes
4. Re-implement changes incrementally with testing at each step
