# Phase 12 Validation Results – Modular Game System & Templates

**Goal:** Validate that reusable systems are implemented correctly and refactors do not break existing games.

---

## ✅ Validation Checklist
- [x] `useGameState` properly handles initialization, updates, and resets
- [x] `useGameCompletion` correctly identifies completed games and triggers appropriate callbacks
- [x] Templates are easy to apply to a new game with minimal boilerplate
- [x] Props and lifecycle methods (`initialState`, `isComplete`, `getFeedback`) work as expected
- [x] Refactored games (e.g., Numberle) behave exactly as before (no gameplay changes)
- [x] No new console warnings or errors introduced by refactor

**Notes:**
- All validation steps were performed on latest Chrome desktop and mobile (Chrome for Android). No issues found.

## 🧪 Edge Cases & Testing
- [x] Templates handle invalid or missing state gracefully
- [x] Multiple games can run simultaneously without state conflicts
- [x] Resetting a game fully clears state and restarts correctly

**Notes:**
- Edge cases tested as described. All behaviors matched expectations. App is stable and robust.
