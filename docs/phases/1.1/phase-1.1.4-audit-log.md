# Phase 1.1.4 Audit Log ‚Äì Partner Game Migration Infrastructure Prep

**Phase Goal:** Prepare for smooth partner integration later.

**Start Date:** [Current Date]
**Status:** In Progress

---

## üìã Phase Overview

Phase 1.1.4 focuses on creating the infrastructure and documentation needed for partner game integration. This includes:
- Creating comprehensive migration checklists
- Documenting shared coding standards
- Establishing commit workflows
- Testing migration pipeline with placeholder games
- Creating integration documentation

---

## üîç Initial Audit

### Current State Analysis
- **Games Implemented:** 4 games (Numberle, Wordle, Shapele, Simonle)
- **Template System:** Basic template system in place with lazy loading
- **Migration Checklist:** Partially created but needs completion and testing
- **Documentation:** Basic structure exists but needs expansion

### Key Findings
1. Basic game template system exists with lazy loading
2. Games follow consistent folder structure (`/src/games/[slug]/`)
3. CSS Modules are used for styling
4. Daily game system is implemented
5. Favorites and recently played systems are in place

### Areas Needing Work
1. Complete migration checklist with all requirements
2. Create comprehensive contributor guide
3. Test migration pipeline with placeholder games
4. Document coding standards and workflows
5. Create troubleshooting and FAQ documentation
