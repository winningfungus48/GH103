## 🚨 Risks & Mitigation

### Risk: Partner game complexity may be higher than expected
**Mitigation:**
- Scope to simple React games only in GH1.1
- Document complexity limits clearly
- Create escalation process for complex games

### Risk: Migration checklist may be incomplete
**Mitigation:**
- Test with multiple game types
- Document edge cases encountered
- Create iterative improvement process

### Risk: Performance requirements may be too strict
**Mitigation:**
- Establish realistic performance benchmarks
- Provide optimization guidelines
- Create performance testing tools

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If integration issues arise:
1. Revert to last stable commit
2. Document specific integration problems
3. Create simplified integration approach
4. Re-implement incrementally with testing
